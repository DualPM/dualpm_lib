# Dual Point Maps
This is a rendering utility for rasterizing a dual mesh to a dual point map.

A dual mesh is a mesh with canonically posed vertices in a canonical coordinate system and simultaneously posed vertices in world coordinates.

Usage:
```
import dualpm
import torch

with torch.inference_mode():
  dual_point_map = dualpm.render_dual_point_map(
    <canonical vertices / torch.Tensor>,
    <posed vertices / torch.Tensor>,
    <faces / torch.Tensor>,
    <view matrix / torch.Tensor>,
    <projection matrix / torch.Tensor>,
    **hparams 
  )
```
for necessary hyperparameters see `dualpm.py`
